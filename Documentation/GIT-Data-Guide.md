# A hitchhikers guide to a data transformation:

The purpose of this document is to walk you through a data transformation project with the key outcome to democratize data for everyone on the service. We are building a service that provides full transparency built for the AI future. We wont just be seeing performance we want to see models with clear outcomes to what the repercussions are of decisions being made. In a where speed of insights is a necessity not a to have. We need to keep up with the times to help the future generation. 

## What does this paper cover?
-	The data journey 
-	Deep dive into the main event(s) 
-	The wider problem 
-	The Marie Condo Formula to database building 
-	Your version, their version and the truth 
-	How big is the data universe 
-	A designer, dev and analyst go to the bar – they also invite other people
o	Design principles to machine learning - How can you apply design principles to analysis to make a service and data accessible

## The data journey:
Needs updating - We have a stage one journey map:
 
As you can see we are starting out with a basic set up where data is everywhere with no connection. Our core data sets are digital and CRM data sets. They are currently not connected in anyway but that wont last long. The ultimate goal is candidate centricity across all services but we need to start small by understanding all the data points first. From our data discovery this is the main event and will form the foundation to all future analytics requirements. We will prioritise events as a transaction as it’s the one transaction that has not performed to the level of others and we want to understand why.

## Deep dive into the main event(s):
We have broken out our deep dive into several areas:
•	Hunt down a data dictionary / schema 
•	Understand what each field means 
•	Outline the fields of interest 
•	Create views with the Raw data and flexible for future analytical needs 

As we started our journey there was no schema and there were circa 1000 + fields with data points that are duplicated, not understood and in most cases meaningless and with non intuitive field names. We have a huge task ahead of us and therefore we needed to start small. 
Given we have to build views and ultimately an environment for future analysis we thought it would be worth building our events table of dreams.
