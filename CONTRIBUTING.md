# Contribution guide

## Goals

* readability.
* documentation should be inline (via comments and README docs) and fairly brief. _why_ is more important than _how_
* don't hard code anything unless absolutely necessary
* someone unfamiliar with the data should be able to get the gist of what's going on

## Tips for readable SQL

* use sensible, descriptive names for views and columns
* keep names and keywords lowercase
* use consistent indentation
* use `snake_case` instead of `camelCase`
* don't add organisational prefixes
* make sure column names make sense **in the context of their table**
